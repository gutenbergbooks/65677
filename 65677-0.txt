PREFACE.


When I survey the divine simplicity and blooming attractions, that are
displayed amongst the variegated tribes of the vegetable creation, I
cease to wonder, that _Queens forego, for a while, the compliments of
a nation, or withdraw from the glitter of a_ COURT, _to be attended
with the more splendid_ EQUIPAGE _of a_ BED _of_ FLOWERS; where nothing
seems wanting but the power of _speech_, to make them become the most
pleasing Monitors.

How far the Author of the following Fables, written for the amusement
of an exalted Personage, may have succeeded, in descriptive fancy, as
a poet: it is hoped, that, the moral and refined admonitions which may
be found to breathe, from the fragrant bosom of a silver-robed Lily, or
a blooming Jonquil, will throw a veil over any poetical inaccuracies;
_for who can paint like Nature?_

As to the novelty of the plan, I cannot but hold myself, in a great
measure, indebted to an ingenious Lady[1], well known in the literary
world. And can only say, that I have found both health and recreation
in the completion of it; by sharing some of the sweetest hours of
contemplation, among the lovely subjects of the following pages.

    THE AUTHOR.

[1] The author of The Vizlis: or Enchanted Labyrinth; an Oriental
Tale, 3 Vols.—Wherein describes with great taste and fancy, the
different passions that are subject to misguide the warm and expanded
imagination, of Youth by the Flowers they make choice of in the
Labyrinth.

ZEPHYRUS AND FLORA: A VISION.


[Illustration]

I.

    As late I wander’d o’er the flow’ry plain,
      Where Cambrian Cluyd pours his silver tide,
    Amidst the pleasures of fair Plenty’s reign,
      And blushing flow’rs and fruits on ev’ry side:


II.

    Soft sigh’d the west winds, murm’ring o’er the dale,
      Whose ev’ry charm rose fresher from the breeze;
    The lofty hills more boldly kiss’d the gale,
      Which skimm’d their tops, and shook the wavy trees.


III.

    The sun descending, shot his golden beams
      Askance, with many a cloud his ev’ning throne
    Adorn’d; while mountains, woods, and lucent streams,
      With the last blushes of his radiance shone.


IV.

    Far stretching hence, Cambria’s rough heights I view,
      Where Liberty long since forlorn retir’d,
    Left fairer climes, and skies of brighter hue,
      And, but at last, triumphantly expir’d:


V.

    And wide around me wound the fertile vale[2],
      Fit theme and subject of the poet’s song;
    Whose num’rous beauties load the passing gale,
      Whose breath repeats them, as it glides along.

[2] The Vale of Cluyd.


VI.

    Bright Phœbus sunk, dim twilight now succeeds,
      Still gleaming dubious with uncertain ray,
    While tremblingly among the vocal reeds
      The ev’ning breezes still more faintly play.


VII.

    Amid this beauteous, soft, and flow’ry scene,
      On a high bank, all listless, I reclin’d;
    Whose shelving sides were crown’d with lively green,
      By tufted trees and bord’ring flow’rs confin’d.


VIII.

    Here, while the landscape faded on my sight,
      Wild Fancy’s eye still brighter scenes supply’d;
    I view’d not the last track of parting light,
      Nor mark’d the fanning breezes as they dy’d.


IX.

    At length, Imagination, roving maid,
      Though gentle sleep had fetter’d all my pow’rs
    In golden chains, my busy soul convey’d
      To other landscapes and immortal bow’rs.


X.

    Methought I stood amidst a garden fair,
      Whose bounds no sight of mortal eye could trace,
    Situate mid-way, betwixt earth, seas, and air,
      Unmark’d by Time, uncircumscrib’d by Space.


XI.

    Not half so sweet was that delightsome dale,
      Which to my waking view appear’d so bright;
    For _here_ did never-ceasing suns prevail,
      With mildest sweetness temp’ring heav’nly light.


XII.

    Spring breath’d eternal glories o’er the land:
      And gentlest winds, o’er fragrant lawns that blow,
    Nurs’d beauteous buds unset by mortal hand,
      And op’ning flow’rs that without planting grow.


XIII.

    Serene the heav’ns, save where a cloudy shrine,
      Big with cœlestial plenty, sail’d on high,
    Show’r’d Spring’s own roses from her seat divine,
      And drew a purple radiance o’er the sky.


XIV.

    Meanwhile, soft music echoing from each grove,
      Tun’d to enchanting notes most soft and clear,
    That breath’d the soul of harmony and love,
      Thrill’d the rapt breast, and charm’d the list’ning ear.


XV.

    And still the while, with voices loud and sweet,
      The warbling birds in dulcet concert join’d,
    The waters murm’ring flow with cadence meet,
      “Low answer’d by the gently whisp’ring wind.”


XVI.

    These themes of wonder silent I survey’d,
      Attentive hanging on each dying sound;
    Pleas’d with the glories which I saw display’d,
      And scenes of joy and pleasure op’ning round.


XVII.

    Yet still methought a certain want appear’d,
      Of some to own this spot, so heav’nly fair,
    Else were each charming flow’ret vainly rear’d,
      “To bloom unnotic’d to the desart air:”


XVIII.

    Else, were in vain these soft melodious strains,
      Which the whole soul of harmony inspir’d,
    Pour’d to the wild woods and the lonely plains,
      Though worthiest still by all to be admir’d.


XIX.

    Such were creation’s first imperfect hours,
      When the gay heav’ns in early beauty shone,
    And earth, bedeck’d with beasts, birds, plants, and flow’rs,
      Spread all her bosom to the genial sun;


XX.

    Unfinish’d still the mighty work appear’d,
      Till Man, the lord of all, was bid to rise;
    With open brow his face divine who rear’d,
      And sought with upright look his native skies.


XXI.

    Thus as I paus’d, still louder swell’d the notes,
      From ev’ry bush, and brake, and echoing hill;
    While choirs cœlestial seem’d to tune their throats,
      And, with glad voice the chearful chorus fill.


XXII.

    Then, by some magic pow’r swift snatch’d away,
      Ev’n to the midst of that delightful land,
    I view’d at once all clad in bright array,
      A thousand Genii of the gardens stand.


XXIII.

    But far above all these a seat was plac’d,
      Dress’d with each flow’r that ev’ry season knows,
    Whose vary’d tints, in gem-like order, grac’d
      The rural theatre which gradual rose.


XXIV.

    For lo! the Genius of each blooming flow’r
      Brought his own fav’rite with peculiar care,
    To deck the arch of this inchanted bow’r,
      And, bowing at the throne, he plac’d it there.


XXV.

    A sight more beauteous ne’er did eye behold,
      Than these bright tribes that glitter’d on the day;
    And, rich in purple dyes and flaming gold,
      Did their bright bosoms to the sun display.


XXVI.

    Such was the throne;—but oh! what pen can trace
      The heav’nly beauties of the matchless Two,
    Who, glowing with each bright cœlestial grace,
      Sat there aloft, conspicuous to the view!


XXVII.

    The first, a youth of sweet and gentle mien,
      With many a wreath and knotted garland crown’d;
    Whose beauteous visage glow’d with charms serene,
      And on whose shoulders purple wings were bound:


XXVIII.

    These when he spreads, reviving Nature pours
      Her copious treasures of immortal bloom;
    Whilst through vast realms he scatters vernal stores,
      And from his downy pinions shakes perfume.


XXIX.

    His name was ZEPHYRUS; and next him sat
      The beauteous goddess of the blooming year,
    The constant partner of his rural state,
      To heav’n and earth, to gods and mortals dear;


XXX.

    FLORA, bright pow’r, who sheds a thousand sweets
      O’er thousand lands, what time her gifts appear,
    What time her consort with his kisses greets
      Her coral lips, and wakes the rising year.


XXXI.

    Her beauteous face was deck’d with youthful pride,
      Her graceful form in flamy robes was dress’d;
    And ev’ry charm wild Nature could provide,
      Adorn’d her head, and beam’d upon her breast.


XXXII.

    Beside the throne, rang’d in fair order, stood
      The various Seasons of the rolling year;
    By all their train of months, weeks, days, pursu’d:
      And all their various symbols flourish’d here.


XXXIII.

    First came the SPRING, led by the rosy Hours,
      With all the Loves and Graces in her train;
    Deck’d with her wreath of never-fading flow’rs,
      Diffusing odours o’er the smiling plain.


XXXIV.

    Next SUMMER came; his cheeks with ardour fir’d,
      With his own blushing fruits and harvests crown’d;
    Before whose face the infant Spring retir’d,
      And with her roses strew’d the russet ground.


XXXV.

    Stain’d with the grape’s press’d juice, with steadier pace,
      Still looking backward on preceding time,
    Ripe AUTUMN next succeeded in his place;
      Scatt’ring rich fruits, the growth of ev’ry clime.


XXXVI.

    Last WINTER comes, with heavy step and flow,
      A hoary captive bound in icy chains;
    With haggard eyes, and mantle dipp’d in snow,
      Who still of cold in Spring’s own realms complains.


XXXVII.

    Not one of these, but from their various store
      Some off’ring meet to lovely Flora pay;
    Not one of these, but with that off’ring more,
      And her soft reign most willingly obey.


XXXVIII.

    Ev’n WINTER’S self, with look averted, throws,
      His thin-strewn flow’rets on the goddess’ shrine;
    Ev’n _his_ cold bosom for a moment glows,
      When he beholds her radiant form divine.


XXXIX.

    But now the Genii of each plant and flow’r,
      Rang’d in fair order, wait her high commands;
    And each, approaching her delicious bow’r,
      In expectation of her verdict stands.


XL.

    For many of the _garden’s_ painted race,
      And some that with their colours deck the _field_,
    Rivals in wealth, in beauty, and in grace,
      Had wag’d high wars, unknowing how to yield.


XLI.

    All claim’d preferment, and each one could boast
      Of some bright beauty or perfection dear,
    Which should induce mankind to prize _her_ most,
      And to preferment make her title clear.


XLII.

    And some, of empty shew and titles vain;
      Alas! that Pride so many should deceive!
    Claim’d o’er their kindred plants and flow’rs to reign:
      And of their birthright others would bereave.


XLIII.

    The Crown Imperial, and the spurious Flow’r
      Which boasts of royal arms and royal mien[3];
    The warlike Plant that claims immortal pow’r[4],
      And that gay lady call’d the Meadow’s Queen.


XLIV.

    All these, and more, that scorn’d a subject state,
      Rose to the claim of high imperial sway:
    Forgetting—to be _good_ was to be _great_—
      They rose to rule, unpractis’d to obey.


XLV.

    Others again for _beauty’s_ meed contend,
      Chief amidst whom appear’d the Tulip race;
    A painted tribe, born only to contend
      For praise, where _all_ is giv’n external grace.


XLVI.

    Alcæa proud[5]; and lovely Venus’ joy,
      That does from adverse winds its title claim[6];
    The once conceited, self-admiring Boy[7],
      Whose love prepost’rous gave a flow’r a name.

[3] Iris, or Fleur de lis.

[4] Larkspur.

[5] The Hollyhock.

[6] Anemone, or Wind Flower.

[7] Narcissus.


XLVII.

    The proud Carnation dipp’d in brightest dyes,
      Who still with thirst of praise and glory burns;
    With her whose mirrour cheats deluded eyes[8],
      And she that still to her lov’d Phœbus turns[9].


XLVIII.

    There, with their num’rous chiefs of diff’rent hues,
      The painted Cock’s Comb, and his lofty train,
    Their beauties vaunting, to the rest refuse
      To share the glories of their gaudy reign.—


XLIX.

    The judges sat, each sep’rate claim was heard,
      While some for _rule_, and some for _praises_, sought;
    And some had been disgrac’d, and some preferr’d,
      As in the goddess’ mind their various pleadings wrought


L.

    But her lov’d consort, gently whisp’ring, said:
      “What means my Queen, on these to cast her sight,
    Who have but pride or lust of sway display’d,
      Nor brought their real worth or virtues to the light?”

[8] Bell Flower, Corn Violet, or Venus’s Looking-Glass.

[9] Clytie, or the Sun-Flower.


LI.

    How many absent now, more fair than these,
      With greater fragrance in lone valleys blow?
    Or, if the garden’s flow’ry tribe more please,
      Where do the Rose and lovely Vi’let glow?


LII.

    The Lily where, and all that num’rous host,
      Who claim true praise to innate virtue due;
    Or do they _merit least_ who _loudest boast_,
      And with false glare impose upon the view?


LIII.

    For sure, of all who feel my genial gale,
      Or to the sun their fragrant breasts unfold,
    The best and sweetest that on earth prevail,
      Yet do I not in this fair court behold.


LIV.

    He said; and FLORA, rising from her throne,
      Bade present search for ev’ry one be made:
    Who, though their off’rings on her altar shone,
      Their modest haste had from the court convey’d.


LV.

    Strait they return’d:—The lovely blushing Rose,
      The Lily ever chaste and ever fair,
    The Vi’let sweet with purple tints that glows,
      And Myrtle green, that scents the ambient air:


LVI.

    With many more, grateful to sight and smell,
      By bounteous heav’n with matchless charms endu’d;
    That in the fragrant meads or gardens dwell,
      Or which wild wastes from human eyes seclude.


LVII.

    These by their Genii now in modest guise,
      Excus’d from pleading ’midst the mingled throng.
    Claim’d but the tribute all allow’d their prize,
      Nor sought their own just praises to prolong.


LVIII.

    Yet, these once seen, abash’d their rivals stand;
      And would have fled, but FLORA this deny’d;
    Who, rising graceful, with her out-stretch’d hand,
      Thus briefly to th’ assembled pow’rs apply’d:


LIX.

    “Genii of gardens, meads, and sylvan scenes,
      Attendant still in FLORA’S vernal train,
    Say what this ardent, fond contention means,
      Why strive you thus for pow’r, and strive in vain?


LX.

    Are you not all beneath our sceptre blest;
      Say, do not all confess our gentle sway?
    Then seek not one to triumph o’er the rest,
      But each in peaceful order still obey.


LXI.

    So _all_ the glories of my reign shall share,
      So _all_ be still in poets songs renown’d,
    So shall my ZEPHYR still with gentlest air,
      Wave o’er your beds, with bloom eternal crown’d.


LXII.

    And _you_, who not for pow’r, but beauty’s charms,
      For gaudy tints, still fiercely would contend;
    What envious fire such gentle bosoms warms?
      And where, alas! must the mad contest end?


LXIII.

    Each has her charms, and each peculiar worth,
      To all in various portions duly giv’n,
    By secret Nature working at its birth,
      The lavish bounty of indulgent Heav’n.


LXIV.

    Each has her charms:—but view the blushing Rose,
      Behold the beauties of the Lily fair;
    Few boast of equal excellence to those,
      Yet with their modest merit none compare.


LXV.

    These, therefore, we prefer; and though no Queen
      Besides Ourselves we will to hold the reign;
    Yet, for their true desart conspicuous seen,
      We rank them foremost on the flow’ry plain.


LXVI.

    Hear, and obey; and if aught else abide,
      To raise dispute among your orders bright;
    Still by true merit let the cause be try’d,
      And specious _shew_ yield to more solid _right_.”


LXVII.

    She spoke;—the Seasons, and the winged Hours,
      Confirm’d her voice; then breath’d a rich perfume,
    Which ZEPHYR scatter’d wide o’er all the flow’rs,
      And deck’d their leaves with more than mortal bloom.


LXVIII.

    Then, his lov’d consort straining in his arms,
      With gentlest touch salutes her swelling breast;
    Who strait shone forth in more refulgent charms,
      As JUNO when by vernal JOVE caress’d.


LXIX.

    And sudden joining in a mazy dance,
      The airy phantoms of the scene appear’d;
    Some to the sprightly timbrel did advance,
      While some their clear harmonious voices rear’d.


LXX.

    But One among the rest, who view’d me stand
      Intent, and gazing on the prospect near,
    Came forth, and gently touch’d my trembling hand,
      And bade me mark his words, and nothing fear:


LXXI.

    “And seest thou not (said he) these vary’d flow’rs,
      Contending still for beauty or for sway?
    Such are the contests which employ man’s hours,
      In life’s short, busy, transitory day.


LXXII.

    For what is gaudy beauty’s short-liv’d bloom,
      The pomp of pow’r, of riches, or of pride;
    Soon bury’d in the undistinguish’d tomb,
      Which all their boasted pomp at once must hide?


LXXIII.

    VIRTUE alone survives, immortal maid!
      Her truly amaranthine flow’r shall blow,
    When all the rest are wrapt in dusky shade,
      And laid in dark and dusty ruins low.


LXXIV.

    Hear, and attend!—improve the moral strain,
      So may’st thou sail safe through life’s dang’rous sea;
    So from these scenes thou wisdom may’st attain,
      And FLORA prove MINERVA’S self to thee.”


LXXV.

    He ceas’d; and well I mark’d the prudent lore,
      And much revolv’d his saying in my mind;
    Bent all the mystic moral to explore,
      By this romantic, splendid scene design’d.


LXXVI.

    But, the full concert swelling on my ear,
      The bands of Sleep dissolv’d, away he flies;
    At once the train of phantoms disappear,
      And on my waking sight the vision dies.


LXXVII.

    No longer now near FLORA’S bow’r I stood,
      But view’d with op’ning eyes the rising day;
    Then down the Valley fair my path pursu’d,
      And homeward took my solitary way.




FABLES OF FLOWERS.


[Illustration: _Fab. I The Holly Hock & Lily of the Vale_]

[Illustration: _Fab. II The Aloe in Blossom_]




FABLE I.


The HOLLYHOCK and the LILY of the VALE.


I.

    ’Twas early morn, Sol’s radiant beams
      Illum’d the landscape round.
    The dew-drops glitter’d on the day,
      And gem-like deck’d the ground.


II.

    Within the garden’s cultur’d walks
      A Hollyhock there grew;
    And there the Lily of the Vale
      Kept humble distance due.


III.

    Elate with pride, the gaudy flow’r
      Expands its swelling breast;
    And, joying in the vernal scene,
      The LILY thus address’d:


IV.

    “What dost thou here, mean paltry thing,
      “Go blow in yonder field;
    “Nor thus disgrace fair FLORA’S tribes,
      “That heav’nly beauties yield.


V.

    “Go, with thy faint and sickly hue;
      “Some chearless vale adorn;
    “But here intrude not on our reign,
      “Nor drink the dew of morn.


VI.

    “Whilst I with heighten’d colours glow,
      “In Summer’s liv’ry gay;
    “Imbibe the softest tints of light,
      “And glitter on the day.


VII.

    “Me yonder golden sun shall warm,
      “At morn and noon-tide hour;
    “And me his ev’ning beams attend,
      “Like his own fav’rite flow’r.


VIII.

    “Nor yonder Rose, nor Bacchus’ Plant,
      “Which twining near me grows,
    “Can boast more excellence than me,
      “Or brighter dyes disclose.


IX.

    “Hence thou! nor this fair spot profane,
      “Where fairer flow’rets blow;
    “Return again to shades obscure,
      “And there neglected grow.”


X.

    The LILY heard, with decent grace,
      That scorn’d the boaster’s pride;
    Then from her lone, unenvy’d bed
      She thus in brief reply’d;


XI.

    “From vaunting loud what fame is gain’d,
      “To raise the boaster’s name;
    “Or might not yonder blushing Rose
      “Exert a fairer claim?


XII.

    “And many a flow’r that round thee blows,
      “In the bright garb of Spring;
    “Or, rich in elegant perfumes,
      “That scent the Zephyr’s wing.


XIII.

    “The vine, with purple clusters deck’d,
      “Shall soon rich sweets bestow;
    “Whilst thou, a barren flow’r at best,
      “Art only made for show.


XIV.

    “For ME;—what Nature form’d, I am;
      “I envy not thy pride;
    “Nor seek to raise a greater boast,
      “By Providence deny’d.


XV.

    “Yet in some dark and dang’rous hour,
      “When tempests rude assail;
    “Ev’n thou may’st wish the humbler state
      “Of LILY OF THE VALE.”


XVI.

    Safe from her humble spot she said,
      And view’d the changing sky;
    From op’ning clouds the thunders break,
      The livid lightnings fly.


XVII.

    Full on the garden’s lofty wall,
      The flow’rs exalted place,
    The fires æthereal swiftly fall,
      And rend its solid base.


XVIII.

    And now the boaster’s trust and pride
      Assur’d her overthrow;
    Her glories buried in the dust,
      By one destructive blow.


XIX.

    The LILY view’d the ruin’d flow’r,
      And strait this Moral drew;
    _Beauty and Pride are idly vain,_
      _But Praise is Merit’s due_.


XX.

    _Daughters of Albion, timely wise,_
      _Attend the moral tale;_
    _And imitate with prudent care_
      THE LILY OF THE VALE.




FABLE II.

The ALOE in BLOSSOM.


I.

    “From warmer climates early borne,
      “Where beams the god of light;
    “How gaily blooms yon lofty plant,
      “In native colours bright!


II.

    “The root, the plant, the leaf, the flow’r,
      “Alike our wonder raise;
    “And all confess the fragrant stock,
      “Renown’d in ancient days.


III.

    “Some say, but one revolving age
      “Beholds thy beauties spread;
    “And rear aloft to genial suns
      “Its highly blooming head.


IV.

    “But thou, like Merit, kindly nurs’d,
      “An early spring wilt know;
    “While, check’d by rigid, frowning skies,
      “Thy gems forget to glow.


V.

    “Emblem of Genius rarely known,
      “And still more rarely giv’n;
    “To reap the good itself imparts,
      “And share the gifts of Heav’n.


VI.

    “Say, glorious stranger, rear’d erewhile
      “In distant, sunny lands;
    “Can either India more bestow,
      “Than Albion’s isle commands?


VII.

    “In western and in southern climes
      “Too long hast thou been plac’d;
    “And India’s sands, and Afric’s wilds,
      “Thy beauteous presence grac’d.


VIII.

    “Deign then, O sov’reign plant, thy balm,
      “On this our land bestow;
    “And give thy flow’rs in all their grace
      “And lustre here to blow.”—


IX.

    The Guardian Sylph, that watch’d the flow’r,
      Confess’d before me stood;
    And shook his bright and sunny locks,
      And thus my suit withstood:


X.

    “Cease, cease, he cry’d, such boons to ask,
      “As scarce deserve a name;
    “While Albion, favour’d from above,
      “Can greater blessings claim.


XI.

    “Still, still, their gems and spicy store,
      “Let either India boast;
    “And Afric vaunt the precious sands,
      “That glitter on her coast.


XII.

    “Not these, nor all the hidden wealth,
      “That earth or sea possess;
    “Can match those richer gifts of heav’n,
      “Which fair Britannia bless.


XIII.

    “Peace, Freedom, Wealth from farthest shores,
      “By golden commerce brought;
    “All these are hers, and ev’ry good,
      “By happiest nations sought.


XIV.

    “Nor _this_ alone; here Genius blooms,
      “A _Flow’r_ excelling _mine_.
    “Nor asks a whole revolving age,
      “In glories to refine.


XV.

    “Here too the Fair, with beauty bright,
      “The hearts of heroes warm;
    “Those _human blossoms_ genial blow,
      “And put forth ev’ry charm.


XVI.

    “Cease then, _nor envy other climes_
      “_Their beauties thinly strewn_;
    “_But learn with decent pride to prize_
      “_The blessings of your own_.”

[Illustration: _Fab. III. The Rose & Hornet_]

[Illustration: _Fab. IV. The Sensitive Plant_]




FABLE III.

The ROSE and the HORNET.


I.

    Deep in a lone sequester’d vale,
      Where many’ a streamlet flows;
    And nurs’d by many’ a gentle gale,
      Soft bloom’d a damask Rose.


II.

    The Summer’s suns, the Zephyrs bland,
      All own’d her peerless queen;
    The honey’d Bee, Spring’s sweetest child,
      Oft’ sought her breast serene.


III.

    Her beauties op’ning on the day,
      With ev’ry grace were crown’d;
    Imbib’d the golden solar beam,
      And deck’d the desart ground.


IV.

    Daughter of Nature, still she blow’d,
      Where human face ne’er shone;
    And spread her blossoms to the view
      But of the Sun alone.


V.

    Pride of the East, a brighter glow,
      Beyond our garden’s bloom,
    Bade her with heighten’d beauty blush,
      And scatter rich perfume.


VI.

    Her rudely rushing through the air
      An angry HORNET ’spy’d;
    Vow’d to enjoy the heav’nly flow’r,
      In all her blooming pride.


VII.

    Bold son of heat, with rudest haste,
    His course he strait address’d;
    To rifle all her charms in spite,
    And riot on her breast.


VIII.

    He search’d each leaf, each blossom wounds
      With rude unhallow’d rage;
    Yet nothing could his search explore,
      His passion to assuage.


IX.

    The beauteous flow’r, though wildly rent,
      No sweetness would afford;
    But hurt by many a vengeful thorn,
      His rashness he deplor’d.


X.

    At length, thus baffled and deceiv’d,
      Enrag’d, he silence broke;
    And now of ev’ry hope bereft,
      He thus insulting spoke;


XI.

    “Vain gaudy flow’r, they term thy breast
      “Engaging, bright, and fair;
    “Who seek thy bosom, ne’er shall find
      “Or joy or sweetness there.


XII.

    “The Bee indeed, thy fav’rite, still
      “Says, Honey springs from thee;
    “Yet nought but trouble, care, and pain,
      “Hast thou bestow’d on me.


XIII.

    “Then boast no more thy beauteous form
      “That still excites desire;
    “Since _Thorns_ alone thou canst bestow,
      “To quench a lover’s fire.”


XIV.

    Then thus the Rose,—“Intruder vile!
      “Who thus would’st force employ;
    “Though arm’d with pow’r; know ’tis not thine
      “To taste substantial joy.


XV.

    “The Bee, who sips each sweet that glows
      “In lawn or shady bow’r,
    “Tastes all the honey as he flies,
      “But never wounds the flow’r.


XVI.

    “Whilst thou, both impious and unwise,
      “Of all our tribes the scorn:
    “For ev’ry violated sweet
      “Shalt always meet a thorn.”




FABLE IV. The SENSITIVE PLANT.


I.

    Rare plant, or flow’r, or nymph-like tree,
      With human sense endu’d;
    Why dost thou shrink beneath the touch,
      And bear but to be _view’d_?


II.

    Say does some Hamadryad chuse
      In that green stem to live?
    And to her highly favour’d shrine
      This strong sensation give?


III.

    Well for thy sake their ancient oaks
      The wood-nymphs might forsake;
    And in thy purer bosom with
      Their lov’d abodes to make.


IV.

    Yet why indignant from each hand
      Alike dost thou retire?
    Does ev’ry touch, replete with ill,
      Alike thy hate inspire?


V.

    Too cautious nymph! well might’st thou deign
      To some thy breast unfold;
    Sure those would _worship_ at the _touch_,
      Who _love_ when they _behold_.


VI.

    Shrunk in herself, with modest grace
      The Plant thus fair reply’d,
    “Whate’er my source, my maiden state
      “But ill agrees with pride[10].

[10] This flower is encompassed with thorns, and its root is said to
have a poisonous quality.


VII.

    “In purity alone I joy;
      “I seek no other fame,
    “But that which from chaste wishes grows,
      “And suits a virgin’s name.


VIII.

    “Nymphs of the woods, the groves, and streams,
      “Too oft have found the smart
    “Of looser fires, which, once indulg’d,
      “Will rankle in the heart.


IX.

    “Me no rude touch shall e’er profane;
      “That guard if once I leave,
    “Of ev’ry virtue well I know
      “Mankind would me bereave.


X.

    “Nor this alone, know, curious youth,
      “A thorny mail I own;
    “Foe to the rash unthinking hand
      “That violates my throne.


XI.

    “And ev’n within this spotless breast
      “Does deadly venom spring;
    “So he that ravishes the sweets,
      “May meet the mortal sting.


XII.

    “Go then, and range from flow’r to flow’r,
      “Amidst the gaudy train:
    “But sacred be my homely plant,
      “To bright-hair’d Vesta’s reign.


XIII.

    “She ceas’d; nor I the flow’r profan’d,
      “To chastity devote;
    “But on the sand with rustic pen,
      “This sacred moral wrote:


XIV.

    _The Nymph who slights strict virtue’s guard,_
      _Shall quickly meet a snare;_
    _And Pleasures, rais’d on Virtue’s bane,_
      _Are fatal, as they’re fair._

[Illustration: _Fab. V The Hawthorn & Primrose_]

[Illustration: _Fab. VI The White Rose & Red_]




FABLE V.

The HAWTHORN and the PRIMROSE.


I.

    Beneath a wild and rustic shade,
      Impervious to the view;
    In the sweet-smiling month of May,
      A lovely Primrose grew.


II.

    The gentle child of early Spring
      By bounteous FLORA crown’d;
    With vernal beauties born to deck
      The unfrequented ground.


III.

    The brightest dye, the sweetest scent,
      Her yellow leaves could yield;
    Were spent upon the empty air,
      Nor e’er adorn’d the field.


IV.

    For round her grew a bushy brake,
      With many’ a thorn beset;
    And many’ a weed obscene and foul
      Deform’d the green retreat.


V.

    But high above the rest advanc’d
      A spreading Hawthorn rose;
    Whose lengthen’d branches overhung
      The seat of her repose.


VI.

    Her gem-like blossoms wide display’d
      The darkling dell adorn;
    With grateful fragrance kiss the wind,
      And drink the dew of morn’.


VII.

    Her the lone Rose in mournful guise
      Full many a day had ey’d;
    And thus at length one summer’s eve
      She all impatient cry’d.


VIII.

    “Ah Thorn! the bane of all my hopes!
      “Ah Thorn! that wound’st my peace!
    “Still must I view thy branches spread,
      “And still my woes increase:


IX.

    “I who long since had, happier far,
      “Been by some fair caress’d;
    “Had drunk the radiance of her eye,
      “And panted on her breast?


X.

    “What have I done, O wretch! that still
      “This evil treatment meets;
    “Or hast thou aught in lieu to give
      “To those who lose my sweets?”


XI.

    She said:—the Hawthorn thus reply’d,
      “Fond pageant of an hour!
    “Art _thou_ displeas’d because _I_ bloom,
      “Though shelter’d by my pow’r?


XII.

    “And know’st thou not that but for _me_
      “Thy boasted bloom were vain;
    “By grazing herds trod under foot,
      “And level’d with the plain?


XIII.

    “_Thee_ I protect; _myself_ am known
      “Among the warlike race;
    “Whom Nature arms with prompt defence
      “Of most excelling grace.


XIV.

    “Nor idly I these weapons wear,
      “Nor idle is my bloom;
    “One arms me for myself and thee;
      “The other sheds perfume.


XV.

    “And oft as this returning month
      “Adds vigour to the year;
    “Crown’d with my gems in rustic dance
      “The nymphs and swains appear.


XVI.

    “Me the fleet hare, and tim’rous fawn,
      “Seek at their greatest need;
    “They rest secure beneath my shade,
      “And on my bounty feed.


XVII.

    “But most the plaintive Philomel,
      “Sweet warbler of the grove,
    “Joys ’midst my branches to repose,
      “And sing her hapless love.


XVIII.

    “Against my thorns her bosom plac’d,
      “She strains her tuneful throat;
    “And by my useful aid exalts
      “Each sweetly trilling note.


XIX.

    “Sacred to FLORA, of her train
      “Although no flow’r am I;
    “And born to flourish many a moon,
      “When thou shalt fade and die.”


XX.

    “Cease then, nor envy this my state,
      “Which must _thy own_ defend;
    “The thorns I bear shall save thy flow’r,
      “And prove thy surest friend.”


XXI.

    So spake the HAWTHORN, justly wise;
      The ROSE unansw’ring heard:
    I caught the Moral, as it rose;
      And thus its sense appear’d:

      _Deserve_ UNENVY’D STATE.




FABLE VI.

The WHITE ROSE and the RED.


I.

    Contending beauties, whom the doom
      Of Fate has still assign’d
    Two fragrant rival flow’rs to blow,
      And scent the western wind;


II.

    The WHITE ROSE and the BLUSHING RED,
      Each one the garden’s pride,
    With equal grace their leaves display’d,
      And flourish’d side by side.


III.

    The _first_ of spotless beauty vain
      That sudden caught the eye,
    The _last_ attentive praise to gain
      From her more sanguine dye.


IV.

    Of sov’reign virtue both well known,
      Both favour’d from above:
    Still full of glory rose each flow’r,
      Emblems of gentle Love.


V.

    Yet ’twixt their stocks wild feuds subsist,
      To work them lasting woe;
    Whilst each of other still complain’d,
      And strove her overthrow.


VI.

    “Shame, said the RED, on that pale hue,
      “Which speaks the wearer’s heart;
    “That, void of virtue as of grace,
      “No colour can impart.


VII.

    “Unlike the blushes that adorn
      “My flow’r with colour meet,
    “AURORA’S, when she wakes the day,
      “Appear not half so sweet.”


VIII.

    “Nay! Shame on thee, the White reply’d,
      “Whose blush by _guilt_ was giv’n:
    “Ev’n by the blood of VENUS shed,
      “Our patroness in Heav’n[11].


IX.

    “Till then like me all Roses were,
      “Whose ancient stock I claim;
    “And, void of crime, still reprobate
      “Their colour with their name.”


X.

    “This and much more she angry said:
      “But JOVE’S immortal flow’r[12]
    “Their ill-meant conversation broke,
      “With soft, persuasive pow’r.

[11] According to the old Fable, the Rose was at first always white,
till Venus, while she was pursuing Adonis, scratched herself with its
thorns, and thereby stained it with her cœlestial blood.

[12] The Amaranth.


XI.

    “Forbear, she cry’d, in haughty guise,
      “Reproachful to contend:
    “Whoe’er the victrix, small her gain,
      “That thus can lose a friend.


XII.

    “Ally’d by Nature in your kind,
      “And diff’ring but in Hue:
    “You both possess intrinsic worth,
      “And outward beauty too.


XIII.

    “Long was the strife your[13] ancient state,
      “In this our isle pursu’d;
    “Which many a year drench’d either Rose,
      “In seas of kindred blood.


XIV.

    “Oh! may no more such horrors rise,
      “Within our Garden’s pale:
    “But all with emulation strive,
      “That concord may prevail!

[13] Alluding to the Civil Wars of York and Lancaster, in which the
White Rose and the Red were adopted as tokens or devices by their
different partisans.


XV.

    “May civil feuds and ranc’rous hate
      “From hence be banish’d far;
    “Foul is that strife, where friends contest,
      “And wage inhuman war.


XVI.

    “Then to this solemn truth give ear;
      “_Where trifles thus are priz’d,_
    “_If two for victory contend;_
      “_They both will be despis’d_.”

FABLE VII.

The CROCUS.


I.

    “Say, beauteous flow’r, whose burnish’d leaves
      “With Spring’s own livery glow:
    “In these bleak months, why dost thou chuse
      “T’ adorn a waste of snow?


II.

    “Say, dost thou grudge to summer-skies,
      “That bloom divinely bright:
    “Or, are thy beauties clearer seen,
      “Through this thin Robe of White?


III.

    “The Snow-drop, thy companion fair,
      “As well thy foil might prove,
    “And both might bloom in seasons sweet,
      “And far from hence remove.


IV.

    “To Summer’s gayer months benign;
      “Should’st thou transfer thy reign,
    “Thy beauties still would brighter glow,
      “And doubly grace the plain.—”


V.

    I said:—the lovely smiling flow’r,
      The beauty of its race;
    And friendly to the sons of men,
      Reply’d with decent grace:


VI.

    “Nature’s great book before thee set:
      “She blames thee not to scan
    “Her works on every side display’d,
      “The fit employ of man.


VII.

    “When Spring and Summer glad the earth,
      “Ten thousand beauties bloom;
    “And various flow’rs of brightest hue,
      “Diffuse a rich perfume.


VIII.

    “Autumn of fruits her tribute brings,
      “With, yellow harvests crown’d;
    “Then laugh the hills and vales, and meads
      “With richest plenty crown’d.


IX.

    “Winter, at length, with gloomy brow,
      “Comes on to close the year;
    “When flow’rs and fruits, and all their race,
      “Almost extinct appear.


X.

    “Yet still some few the gracious Pow’rs
      “Permit of these to bloom:
    “Nor heap alike all FLORA’S race,
      “In one remorseless tomb.


XI.

    “And soon as to the wat’ry Signs,
      “The Sun retreats again;
    “Then she my flamy dyes awakes,
      “And bids me deck the plain.


XII.

    “Nor less my worth because ’midst snows,
      “My head I early rear;
    “My flow’r still fresh and lively blooms,
      “As at the closing year.


XIII.

    “And know, when Autumn’s Sun prevails,
      “My kindred flow’rs arise;
    “In forms which heav’nly pow’rs might praise,
      “And scent the ambient skies[14].


XIV.

    “These ev’ry dismal gloom dispel;
      “Which mis’ry can impart,
    “And joy and gladness still inspire,
      “And harmonize the heart.


XV.

    “Meanwhile my earlier station here,
      “(Health’s harbinger) I keep,
    “To glad the sad and cloudy days;
      “When Spring’s soft Zephyrs sleep.

[14] It is here to be noted that the autumnal Crocus is the Saffron
Flower, so famous in Medicine.


XVI.

    “So, in the Winter of his days,
      “Chear thou thy drooping friend;
    “His sorrows sooth, his griefs assuage,
      “And prompt assistance lend.


XVII.

    “So, when his fate and fortune lour,
      “Thy better aid impart;
    “And with thy fortune’s warmer ray,
      “Revive his dying heart.


XVIII.

    She said;—the moral well became
      The sweet, propitious flow’r;
    I mark’d the lore with heedful mind,
      And own’d fair FRIENDSHIP’S pow’r.




FABLE VIII.

The ANEMONE and the PASSION FLOWER.


I.

    “Bright flow’r renown’d in ancient times,
      “Amidst the Cyprian shades;
    “The theme of wonder and of praise
      “To soft Sidonian maids.


II.

    “Hail! Goddess-born! hail! thou produc’d
      “From the bright mingled flood
    “Of VENUS’ tears, as bards have sung,
      “And her ADONIS’ blood.


III.

    “Rich are thy blossoms in each hue
      “That can inchant the fight;
    “And strike at once the ravish’d eye
      “With wonder and delight.


IV.

    “Hail! sacred Plant, born but to shew
      “ADONIS’ yearly wound;
    “By gentle VENUS taught to bloom,
      “With heav’nly beauties crown’d.”


V.

    I said; when lo; an awful form
      Upon my orgies broke;
    And, like some bright cœlestial pow’r,
      In lofty accents spoke:


VI.

    “Hence, thou profane; nor wound me thus
      “With thy unhallow’d song;
    “But turn, and see, who blossoms here,
      “To whom thy strains belong.


VII.

    “The Tyrian Boy, and VENUS’ self;
      “Before my face shall fly;
    “Their beauty gone, their lustre lost,
      “And all their charms shall die.


VIII.

    “I am the only flow’r on earth,
      “With signs divine adorn’d;
    “By me, of Heav’n thus favour’d high,
      “All Pagan Gods are scorn’d.


IX.

    “The purple ring, the bloody crown,
      “The nails, and guilty spear,
    “That slew the Lord of Life, behold
      “In my symbolic sphere.


X.

    “Deep to Lethéan shades my root
      “Still downward seems to tend;
    “As from the Cross’s sacred base,
      “To Hell it would descend.


XI.

    “Then here thy mis-plac’d rev’rence shew,
      “And bow before this shrine;
    “Where Angel Hosts themselves might pray,
      “And own the Plant divine.”


XII.

    She said; ADONIS’ flow’ret bow’d,
      As to superior pow’r;
    My conscious heart was struck with dread;
      Before the wond’rous flow’r.


XIII.

    But whilst intent my rev’rence there
      With honour due to pay;
    The heav’ns withdrew their useful light,
      And clos’d the hours of day.


XIV.

    I look’d;—no more those signs I saw,
      Which had my rev’rence drawn:
    For ever shut the mirrour stood[15],
      Which thus had grac’d the lawn.


XV.

    A while I gaz’d; at length I cry’d,
      And art THOU mortal too?
    Are all THY sacred beauties fled,
      Or faded on the view?

[15] This flower opens in the morning, and fades away in the evening,
closing up, and never opening again.

The LILY and NARCISSUS.


I.

    “Ah! hapless discontented flow’r,
      “That yellow leaves adorn;
    “Who once in life’s gay vernal pride
      “The brightest nymphs could’st scorn.


II.

    “Hard was thy lot, and short thy date,
      “By form too fair undone;
    “Thou met’st, alas! a timeless doom,
      “Ere half thy course was run.


III.

    “Unhappy, self-admiring youth,
      “A lesson thou shalt prove;
    “T’ avoid vain pride, that idle toy,
      “And shun prepost’rous love.


IV.

    “Fair when a boy, now chang’d, no more
      “Those beauties can’st thou boast;
    “But ever sadly may’st repent
      “In vain those beauties lost.


V.

    “View yonder Lily’s snowy pride,
      “Sprung from a seed divine;
    “Then own how much her beauty bright,
      “Fond flow’r, out-rivals thine!”


VI.

    With modest grace the Lily bow’d
      The honours of her head;
    Then, with a sweet and modest grace,
      She thus instructive said:


VII.

    “Well may they droop, to whom their fate,
      “With form divinely fair,
    “No other, better boon has giv’n
      “To make that beauty dear.


VIII.

    “For not this glossy white I bear,
      “Delight of human eyes;
    “Nor this so graceful form admir’d,
      “Are what I wish to prize.


IX.

    “From heav’nly strain[16] I first arose,
      “Emblem of chaste desires;
    “And still that chastity retain,
      “And check unhallow’d fires.


X.

    “No empty self-admirer, I
      “Would Folly’s trophies raise;
    “Such _virtue_ then let all applaud,
      “Not empty _beauty_ praise.”

[16] According to the Old Fable, Jupiter being willing to make Hercules
immortal, caused him to suck Juno while she was asleep; when the milk
gushing out into a great quantity, some of it being spilt upon the
sky, made the galaxy or milky way there, while the rest falling to the
earth, gave birth to the White Lily.


XI.

    She said; and strait the moral found
      Deep entrance in my breast;
    BEAUTY, _if not with_ VIRTUE _join’d,_
      _Is but an idle jest_.




FABLE X.

The IVY and SWEET BRIAR.

    “Hail, sacred IVY! hail,” I said,
      “Devote to BACCHUS’ shrine;
    “Parent of wreaths, which deck the brows
      “Of Gods and men divine.


II.

    “Why call thee baleful, why despise
      “Thy ancient friendly race;
    “Who clasp the Elm and sturdy Oak
      “In mystical embrace.


III.

    “MINERVA’S bird too deigns to dwell
      “Where thou art frequent seen;
    “Who loves the calm and peaceful hour,
      “And courts the deep serene.


IV.

    “Thou, like the Vine, thy patron’s joy,
      “Thy nurture wilt receive,
    “And, twining close with friendly arms,
      “Wilt still supported live.


V.

    “With PHŒBUS’ laurel justly thou
      “May’st hold divided claim;
    “The crown of glorious conquerors,
      “And meed of deathless fame.”


VI.

    Thus whilst I spoke, the West wind rose,
      And scatter’d rich perfume,
    From thickets, where sweet Eglantine
      Appear’d in vernal bloom.


VII.

    Thence a soft voice salutes my ear,
      Which thus complaining said;
    “Fond youth, to yonder noxious weed
      “Why all these honours paid?


VIII.

    “The Vine, ’tis true, will wed her Elm;
      “But view the dow’r she brings!
    “From yonder steril, forc’d embrace
      “Alas! what profit springs?


IX.

    “Like a false friend, too sure, she twines,
      “Intent but to destroy;

X.

    “How poor that _virtue_, which retires
      “To solitude for aid!
    “_How weak that wisdom_, which can shine

XI.

    “And what, though gods and godlike men
      “Their victor brows have bound
    “With ivy’d wreaths; is then the weed
      “For that alone renown’d?


XII.

    “Say rather, in that purer age,
      “When spotless honour reign’d;
    “The victor, seeking only fame,
      “A worthless crown obtain’d.


XIII.

    “Hence Ivy, Parsley, Oaken Boughs,
      “Their labour well repaid,
    “Who not for gain, but glory’s charms,
      “Their gen’rous strength display’d.


XIV.

    “But thou, regardful of fair truth,

XV.

    “_Not borrow’d names from high descent,_

The VIOLET TRANSPLANTED.


I.

    Where fragrant field-flow’rs, gaily spread,
      Drink deep the morning dew;
    Close by a murm’ring riv’let’s side
      An humble Vi’let grew.


II.

    To her the cultur’d spot unknown,
      She bloom’d in her retreat;
    And there in native fragrance bless’d,
      Dispers’d a world of sweet.


III.

    But yet not undisturb’d her lot
      By Providence was cast;
    For oft’ the herds went grazing forth
      And laid the meadow waste.


IV.

    And oft’ the trav’ler’s careless step
      Had laid her on the plain;
    Yet, by the living streamlet fed,
      She soon reviv’d again.


V.

    At length a curious Florist saw
      The sweetly blooming flow’r;
    Call’d her the field’s and garden’s pride,
      And plac’d her in his bow’r.


VI.

    Here, with a thousand beauties rang’d,
      Her elegance was lost;
    No more the cultur’d spot she grac’d;
      No more fair FLORA’S boast.


VII.

    Abandon’d by his hand, who first
      Her charms with pleasure view’d;
    She in her rise beheld her fate,
      And now neglected stood.


VIII.

    She droop’d, she pin’d; the richer soil
      No nurture could afford;
    And oft’ in vain her humbler lot
      The fading flow’r deplor’d.


IX.

    The happier tribes that flourish’d round
      Did each her state deride;
    Rejoicing that she paid so dear
      For what they deem’d her pride.


X.

    The Sun in Cancer flam’d aloft
      Dry thirst her moisture drank;
    In vain she wish’d the lucent flood,
      Or shade of osiers dank.


XI.

    Oppress’d at length she drooping fell,
      As ready to expire;
    Her bosom unresisting spread
      To Sol’s consuming fire.


XII.

    When lo! from heav’n a gentle rain
      Cool’d that too fervid ray;
    And soon reviv’d the beauteous flow’r,
      Which glow’d upon the day.


XIII.

    Her bloom restor’d, renew’d again;
      Her former lord attends;
    And midst the fairest of the fair
      She numbers now her friends.


XIV.

    Yet, deeply struck with former ills,
      An humble flow’r she blooms;
    No pride that lovely bosom knows,
      Whence ZEPHYR steals perfumes;


XV.

    And to the Fair this useful truth
      She evermore reveals;
    _That she best knows her Beauty’s force,_
      _Who modestly conceals_.




FABLE XII.

The TULIP and the AMARANTH.


I.

    Where various beauties mingled rise,
      All grateful to the view;
    With variegated beauties bright,
      A gaudy TULIP grew.


II.

    Its leaves with flamy splendour shine,
      Mix’d with more vivid green;
    And all the tints that deck heav’n’s bow
      Upon the flow’r are seen.


III.

    The gently passing vernal air
      The beauteous plant caress’d;
    And ZEPHYR ever pleas’d reclin’d
      Upon the charmer’s breast.


IV.

    While near at hand the GENTLE FLOW’R,
      Call’d AMARANTH, below
    The blooming guest of JOVE’S own seats,
      Deign’d in her prime to grow.


V.

    Yet she with hairs uncouthly deck’d,
      Unlike the Tulip race,
    Is not among the flowr’ets found,
      Whose colours mark their grace.


VI.

    This swell’d her rival’s empty pride,
      And, vain of empty shew;
    The Amaranth askance she ey’d,
      And thus contemptuous spoke;


VII.

    “Of all the flow’rs that deck the lawn,
      “The progeny of Spring;
    “And all that of maturer birth
      “The later seasons bring:


VIII.

    “Of all that for their fairer forms
      “May raise the justest claim;
    “Of all that men for beauty prize,
      “Or from perfection name:


IX.

    “Behold me, first and fairest known,
      “Still lov’d and valu’d most;
    “Soft daughter of the vernal hour,

X.

    “Why deign I then so long with _these_
      “To dwell without reserve;
    “That scarce, though vulgar eyes they charm,
      “The name of FLOW’R deserve?”


XI.

    The blooming Amaranth, unmov’d,
      Repress’d her forward pride;
    The boaster’s arrogance despis’d,
      And wisely thus reply’d;


XII.

    “Yes, gaudy thing; thy various hues
      “Are fine indeed and gay;
    “Glaring thou glitter’st on the sight,
      “And flaunt’st it to the day!


XIII.

    “No flow’r around more bright can blow,
      “In beauty more mature!
    “But tell me, false, frail, giddy thing,
      “How long shall that endure?


XIV.

    “Me, not the least of FLORA’S tribe,
      “Me thou hast laugh’d to scorn,
    “And deem’d my claim to beauty vain,
      “Although cœlestial born.


XV.

    “For know, though scarce allow’d by thee
      “To rank among the flow’rs;
    “From Heav’n I draw my high descent,
      “And bloom’d in Eden’s bow’rs.


XVI.

    “And still eternal is my race,
      “No frail decay I know;
    “But, emblem of the first great Spring,
      “For ever bloom below.


XVII.

    “But thou! the pageant of an hour,

THE HONEYSUCKLE.

    At height of noon, a youth reclin’d
      Beneath a woodbine bow’r;
    Defended by whose thick’ning shade,
      He pass’d the sultry hour,


II.

    But when mild breezes cool’d the air,
      And length’ning shadows rose;
    He scann’d with philosophic mind
      The place of his repose.


III.

    High over-head the twining boughs,
      Where thousand blossoms glow,
    Of ev’ry beam of light bereave
      The cool alcove below.


IV.

    “Ah! (said the youth) ungrateful still!
      “And dost thou thus repay
    “The bounties of that glorious God,
      “Who wak’d thee into day?


V.

    “While he in his meridian course
      “Illumines wide the sky;
    “Dost thou, O wretch, resist his pow’r,
      “And all his beams defy?


VI.

    “Unlike to thee, ingrate, behold
      “The Sun-flow’r drinks his light;
    “Lives, to his radiance ever true,
      “And with him sinks to night.


VII.

    “But like some faithless fav’rite you,
      “Or some more faithless fair;
    “Spurn at the very pow’r that grac’d,
      “And made you what you are.


VIII.

    “Oh! useful lesson to be learn’d,
      “With scanty hand to pour
    “Those blessings, which, when once conferr’d,
      “Shall ne’er be thought on more!”


IX.

    Unmov’d the beauteous Woodbine heard,
      Then, nodding from on high,
    Shook the green honours of her brow,
      As thus she made reply:


X.

    “Vain is the hypocritic plea
      “That gilds the selfish end;
    “And base the poor unfeeling heart
      “That ill repays a friend.


XI.

    “For _me_, not such my care ill-plac’d;—
      “My blessings unconfin’d,
    “I give each gentle breathing air,
      “And scatter to the wind.

    “What if my leaves exclude that Pow’r
      “By whom thou say’st I live;

    “My fragrance, nay, that friendly shade,
      “Which you ungrateful blame,
    “Are off’rings still to PHŒBUS’ self,

    “He, for the use of base mankind,
      “Bade me all these dispense:

    “Ungrateful THOU, thy ill-meant charge
      “Take back, so mis-apply’d:
    “And fairly reason with thy heart,
      “And check thy selfish pride.

    “Thou, in my shadows late reclin’d,

    O’er verdant lawns, and dappled meads,

    On ev’ry tree, on ev’ry flow’r,
      Philosophis’d the maid.

    The Cowslip, and the Primrose too,
      Had oft-times been her theme;
    And yellow Crocus’ flaming dyes

    Absorb’d and lost in Nature’s maze,

    ’Twas smiling May; the op’ning year

    From cultur’d gardens far remote

    To court the touch of her fair hand,
      Each field-flow’r eager press’d;
    To bask beneath her funny eyes,
      And kiss her snowy breast.

    Amongst the crowd, a flow’r she ’spy’d,
      Long since well known to fame;
    Of _Venus’ Looking-glass_ whose pride
      Assum’d the pompous name.

    “And how! she cry’d, can’st thou display,

    She sought in vain; a bell-shap’d flow’r,
      With Vi’let blossoms crown’d:
    Diffus’d itself with mingled corn,
      And purpled o’er the ground.


XI.

    She pluck’d, but strait away she cast
      The vain pretender far;
    Which angry ruffled all its flow’rs,
      In vegetable war:

    “What had bright VENUS’ mirrour done,

    “Peace! angry thing! BELINDA said;
      “Not VENUS I despise;

    “What boots it thus your high descent,

    “Go! in yon’ _real_ mirrour view

    “A Blue-bell of the finest dye,

[18] Apollo having forsaken Clytie for this Nymph; the former, in
return, informed Leucothoe’s father of his daughter’s amour with
Phœbus. He thereupon buried Leucothoe alive; but Phœbus changed her

[20] A Volcano in the North, whose sides are covered with snow.

[21] The Mountains of NIEMI are in the neighbourhood of a lake of the
same name, which is said by the inhabitants to be frequented by the
immortal Genii.

    And thence where TENGLIO[22] rolls his stream,
      Survey’d the prospect round;
    Beheld its banks with verdure deck’d,
      And blushing roses crown’d.

[22] This River is bordered with Roses of as fine a bloom as those
which grow in our gardens.

    Stuck with the scene, a while he paus’d,
      As lost in sweet delight;
    And ey’d the fairest of the train
      In native beauty bright.

    Yet, as he view’d the stranger flow’r,
      He deeply musing cries,
    “How strange that beauties such as thine
      “’Midst climes like these should rise!


VI.

    “Thee no bright youth nor gentle fair
      “Alas! shall e’er caress;
    “Nor splendid southern suns shall warm,
      “Nor genial gales shall bless!”


VII.

    On hollow winds, o’er distant plains,
      The murm’ring accents flew;
    NIEMI’S mountains caught the sound,
      Which from the lake his shadows drew.


VIII.

    And now before the youth confess’d
      The Genius of the clime
    Appear’d; who thus instructive spoke,

    “Fond youth, who view’st that beauteous flow’r,
      “So luckless in thy fight!

      “Whom these rude climes delight.

    “Unrival’d here she sweetly blooms,
      “And scents the ambient air;
    “Nor deems her brightest beauties lost,
      “While foster’d by _my_ care.


XI.

    “Nor envies she the gaudy tribe
      “Beneath the southern skies,
    “That bloom in some luxurious bow’rs,
      “Where mingled sweets arise.


XII.

    “The child of bounteous Nature! here
      “She bids her bloom dispense
    “Fresh sweets, the trav’ler’s soul to chear,
      “And glad his weary’d sense.

    “Her no bright youth nor gaudy fair

    “And, oft’ as yon’ returning Sun
      “Illumes our northern sphere,

    “Let _others_ seek where spacious meads,

[23] The juice of this weed was generally supposed to be used in
Enchantments—There are however several sorts of it, all of which are
not esteemed deadly; but only this mentioned here, the juice of whose
berries so intoxicated the army of Sweno the Danish King, being mixed
in their liquor, that they became an easy prey to the Scotch army,
which surprised and cut most of them to pieces.

    Lo! there each mournful flow’r he strew’d,
      Which vernal FLORA bears;
    With frequent sighs dispers’d them round,
      And water’d them with tears.


IV.

    There was the VI’LET’S purple hue,
      And HYACINTHUS seen;

      And plaintive notes between.

      “Your utmost skill employ.”


XIX.

    He ceas’d;—the Nymph her task forsook,
      And still together bloom
    The beautous Tree, and fragrant Flow’rs,
      Whence ZEPHYRS steal perfume.




FABLE XXVI.

The COCK’S COMB and SWEET WILLIAM.


I.

    High rose the Sun, the fleeting hours
      Verg’d tow’rds meridian height,
    And all around the glitt’ring scene
      Was lost in floods of light.


II.

    The flocks and herds, that graz’d awhile,
      Now left the sunny glade;
    And in the stream their fervour cool’d,
      Or sought the shelt’ring shade.


III.

    Beneath a high projected fence,
      At this irradiate hour,
    The sweet _Dianthus_[25] humbly blew,
      A solitary Flow’r.

[25] Another name for Sweet William.


IV.

    But where a thousand mingling sweets
      Diffus’d a rich perfume;
    The gaudy COCK’S COMB, idly vain,
      Appear’d in all its bloom.


V.

    And “Matchless excellence!” he cry’d,
      “With ME what can compare?
    “The sweetest of the vernal train
      “Were never half so fair.


VI.

    “My crested head erect I rear,
      “And bloom with matchless grace;
    “The brightest hue my leaves adorns,
      “Of all the flow’ry race.


VII.

    “Nay, to immortal pow’rs a-kin,
    “Descent from Heav’n I claim[26];
    “And from eternal-blooming Flow’rs
    “Derive my honour’d name.”

[26] This Flower is a kind of Bastard Amaranth.


VIII.

    I view’d the Plant, its form admir’d;
      When a more modest Flow’r
    Engag’d my eye, where soft it rose
      Within its lonely bow’r.


IX.

    “Sweet tribes, (he sang,) fair FLORA’S care,
      “What beauties you display!
    “My breast expands with social joy
      “To see your bright array.


X.

    “To _me_, the last of flow’rets, give,
      “Within this pale to grow:
    “And give the west winds gentle breath
      “O’er this my bed to blow.”


XI.

    He spoke—the pow’rs indulgent heard,
      Soft ZEPHYRS fann’d the trees;
    And o’er his humble earthy bed
      Diffus’d a gentle breeze.


XII.

    Smit with the fragrance of the scent
      The winds rejoicing bore;
    I own’d the pow’r of modest worth,
      Whose rival charm’d no more[27].


XIII.

    Say, Fair-ones, is the Moral plain,
      In easy Fable drest?
    It is but this—_To Merit true,_
      _Throw Coxcombs from your breast_.

[27] The Cock’s Comb being a gaudy Flower, without any agreeable smell
to recommend it.

FABLE XXVII.

The JASMINE and HEMLOCK.


I.

    Tow’ring aloft, a JASMINE sweet
      In a rich garden stood;
    And thence, nurs’d by wild Nature’s care,
      The neighb’ring HEMLOCK view’d.


II.

    High o’er the pale the angry flow’r
      Rear’d her affronted head;
    And, glowing in her vernal bloom,
      She thus contemptuous said:


III.

    “Say, worse than Aconite, pernicious weed!
      “How dar’st thou here to grow;
    “And thy detested head advance,
      “Near where my blossoms blow?”


IV.

    The angry HEMLOCK strait reply’d,
      “Thou proud insulting thing!
    “Vain is thy pride, and vain thy boast,
      “Though deck’d by gaudy Spring.


V.

    “Thou, in the blooming garden plac’d,
      “May’st please the roving eye.
    “I in some field or secret shade
      “My useful aid supply.


VI.

    “Nay, scornful flow’r! what I declare,
      “Great Nature’s self will own:
    “Ordaining all things fair and good,
      “When once their use is known.


VII.

    “Go ask of genial BACCHUS’ tree,
      “Where purple clusters glow;
    “(Whose juice produces gen’rous wine,
      “The balm of human woe.)


VIII.

    “Go ask what various ills attend,
      “That precious balm’s abuse:
    “Ills that too surely ev’n exceed
      “Those of my baneful juice.


IX.

    “Yet baneful _where_? when _mis-apply’d_;
      “So is each blessing too.
    “This lesson learn, and know thyself;
      “Nor rob me of my due.


X.

    “Me the grave Leech, who, greatly wise,
      “Turns Nature’s volume o’er,
    “Oft snatches from my low abode,
      “And places in his store.


XI.

    “There, amongst health-bestowing plants,
      “He ranks my honour’d name;
    “And, whilst he well employs _my_ pow’rs,
      “Exalts _himself_ to fame.


XII.

    “Thus death and life alike are _mine_,
      “Neither to _thee_ belong:
    “Though oft’ by poets most admir’d,
      “The theme of idle song.


XIII.

    “Be thou so still; but ne’er despise
      “Those gifts thou canst not share:
    “But keep this maxim in thy heart,
      “_The_ USEFUL _is the_ FAIR.”


XIV.

    She said—abash’d the JASMINE heard,
      And hung her drooping head;
    She saw, _That_ NATURE’S _works were good_,
      And all her Boasting fled.




FABLE XXVIII.

The CARNATION and SOUTHERNWOOD.


I.

    Rich in a thousand beauteous dyes,
      The sweet CARNATION stood;
    While with a proud disdainful eye
      The SOUTHERNWOOD she view’d.


II.

    “Great is thy Pride,” the flow’r exclaim’d,
      “To place thee near my side;
    “For ev’n to grow in this retreat,
      “Argues thy matchless pride.


III.

    “Say, what art thou, thyself no flow’r,
      “That dar’st intrude thee here;
    “’Midst plants fit for a prince’s bow’r,
      “Flow’rs fit for kings to wear?


IV.

    “Whate’er I am,” the Plant reply’d,
      “My post I well maintain;
    “And chearful lend my needful aid,
      “Where thine, alas! were vain.


V.

    “Say, could thy flow’rs of brightest dye
      “_Infection’s_ force withstand?
    “Ah! what could all thy beauties do,
      “If plagues laid waste the land?


VI.

    “Mean as I am, the task is mine,
      “To purge th’ unwholesome air;
    “To clear the brain, the blood refine,
      “And seat HYGEIA[28] there.

[28] The Goddess of Health.


VII.

    “Nay farther still;—thyself shalt own
      “How oft’ I’m join’d with thee;
    “And thy bright blossoms brighter bloom,
      “Because they’re plac’d by me.


VIII.

    “Are not the _various tints_, which deck
      “This scene, the Florist’s pride?
    “ME then, imperious! venerate
      “For pow’rs to thee deny’d.—


IX.

    “Say, if each warbler of the grove
      “Should chuse the self-same strain;
    “Would the tir’d ear the concert please,
      “Or wish to hear again?


X.

    “Nature, who made us what we are,
      “Did diff’rent gifts impart;
    “And gave to all their portion due
      “Of her all-plastic art.


XI.

    “Contented then in diff’rent spheres
      “Unenvying let us move:
    “For this must still most grateful be
      “To THOSE who rule above.


XII.

    “_Me_ let _thy_ sweetest fragrance grace,
      “Ev’n from the early May;
    “And _thee_ will _I_ in gardens fair
      “With sov’reign balm repay.


XIII.

    “For, thus united while we stand,
      “We need to ask no more;
    “While mutually we take and give,
      “We double all our _store_.”


XIV.

    Prudent she said;—her rival, pleas’d,
      Adopts the smelling green;
    And one for _Use_, and one for _Show_,
      Together now are seen.


XV.

    Learn hence, _That various talents giv’n_
      _Mean variously to bless:_
    _And thus on mutual wants kind Heav’n_
      _Builds mutual Happiness_.

FABLE XXIX.

The ROSEMARY and FIELD FLOWER.


I.

    Upon the fam’d HYPANIS’ banks,
      By chance, in days of yore,
    A tuft of Rosemary there grew,
      Which scented all the shore.


II.

    And near at hand a Field-flow’r rear
      Its variegated head;
    And view’d full many a spacious track,
      With dreary desarts spread.


III.

    But where the river roll’d its stream,
      Unnumber’d insects swarm’d;
    Which rose in myriads into life,
      By PHŒBUS’ influence warm’d[29].

[29] On the banks of the river Hypanis, there is a sort of insect,
whose life is said only to extend from the rising to the setting of the
sun.


IV.

    The same revolving day that saw
      Their scene of life begun,
    Beheld them sink to dust again,
      With the declining sun.


V.

    And one of these, at noon-tide hour,
      (The hardiest of his race)
    Urg’d to the Field-flow’r bright and gay
      His quick and eager pace.


VI.

    But when no fragrant scent he found
      In that same flow’r so bright;
    He to the sweeter Rosemary
      Immediate urg’d his flight.


VII.

    The _lasting_ aromatic plant,
      His speed with wonder view’d;
    Advis’d him other flow’rs to seek,
      Nor on her spot intrude.


VIII.

    “And how can I for _thee_ (she said)
      “My happier pow’rs display,
    “Or with my lasting flow’r support
      “The insect of a day?


IX.

    “Sure Nature form’d thy race in sport,
      “Continual to destroy;
    “Nor ever meant thy race to taste
      “One pure, substantial joy.”


X.

    “Not so,” the wiser Insect cry’d,
      “My high descent I claim
    “From PHŒBUS’ self—you cannot more,
      “Nor wish a higher name.


XI.

    “What if to me a shorter date
      “By Nature’s law is giv’n;
    “Each moment that I live, _t’ enjoy_,
      “Is all I ask of Heav’n.


XII.

    “Beneath the Mushroom’s spacious shade,
      “Or in the mossy bow’r,
    “Or still at noon as _now_ reclin’d,
      “Beneath some fragrant flow’r.


XIII.

    “Know, that as much of life I trace
      “In one revolving sun;
    “As yonder herds, whose destin’d course
      “Full many an age has run.


XIV.

    “For equal are great Nature’s gifts,
      “And but an idle dream;
    “The boast of time, which glides away
      “Swift as the passing stream.


XV.

    “Well to employ the present hour,
      “Sweet plant, be ever thine;
    “LIFE’S little day, _when once elaps’d_,
      “_Shall seem as short as_ MINE.”




FABLE XXX.

The JUDGEMENT of FLOWERS.


I.

    Far from the busy haunts of men,
      Far from the glaring eye of day;
    Still Fancy paints, with Nature’s pen,
      Such tints as never can decay.


II.

    Hast thou not seen, at ev’ning hour,
      When PHŒBUS sunk beneath the main,
    Reclin’d in some sequester’d bow’r,
      The village maid, or shepherd swain?


III.

    Hast thou not mark’d them cull with care
      Some favour’d flow’ret from the rest,
    To deck the breast, or bind the hair,
      Of those they priz’d and lov’d the best?


IV.

    And still expressive of the mind
      The emblematic gift was found;
    Whether to mournful thought inclin’d,
      Or with triumphant gladness crown’d.—


V.

    Near AVON’S banks, a cultur’d spot,
      With many a tuft of flow’rs adorn’d,
    Was once an aged shepherd’s lot,
      Who scenes of greater splendor scorn’d.


VI.

    Three beauteous daughters bless’d his bed,
      Who made the little plat their care;
    And ev’ry sweet by FLORA spread
      Attentive still they planted there.


VII.

    Once, when still ev’ning veil’d the sky,
      The sire walk’d forth, and sought the bow’r;
    And bade the lovely maids draw nigh,
      And each select some favour’d flow’r.


VIII.

    The first, with radiant splendor charm’d,
      A variegated Tulip chose:
    The next, with love of beauty charm’d,
      Preferr’d the sweetly-blushing Rose.


IX.

    The third, who mark’d, with depth of thought,
      How those bright Flow’rs must droop away,
    An Ev’ning Primrose only brought,
      Which opens with the closing day.


X.

    The sage a while in silence view’d
      The various choice of flow’rs display’d;
    And then (with wisdom’s gift endu’d)
      Address’d each beauteous list’ning maid!


XI.

    “Who chose the Tulip’s splendid dyes,
      “Shall own, too late, when that decays,
    “That, vainly proud, not greatly wise,
      “She only caught a short-liv’d blaze.


XII.

    “The Rose, though beauteous leaves and sweet
      “Its glorious vernal pride adorn:
    “Let her who chose beware to meet
      “The biting sharpness of its thorn.


XIII.

    “But _she_, who to fair day-light’s train
      “The Ev’ning flow’r more just preferr’d;
    “Chose real worth, nor chose in vain
      “The one great object of regard.


XIV.

    “Ambitious _thou_! the Tulip race
      “In all life’s vary’d course beware:
    “Caught with sweet Pleasure’s rosy grace,
      “Do _thou_ its sharper thorns beware.


XV.

    “_Thou_ prudent still to Virtue’s lore,
      “Attend, and mark her counsels sage!
    “She like _thy flow’r_ has sweets in store,
      “To soothe the ev’ning of thine age.”


XVI.

    He ceas’d—attend the moral strain,
      The Muse enlighten’d pours;
    Nor let her pencil trace in vain
      The Judgement of the Flow’rs.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that:

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
